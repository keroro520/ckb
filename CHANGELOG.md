    0x94334bdda40b69bae067d84937aa6bbccf8acd0df6626d4b9ac70d4612a11933

### Highlights

* #922: Feat: proposer reward (@zhangsoledad)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus

    1. earliest transaction proposer get 40% of the transaction fee as a reward.
    2. block reward finalized after proposal window close.
    3. enforce one-input one-output one-witness on cellbase.

* #1054: Replace system cell (@driftluo, @jjyr)

    See [feat: use recoverable signature to reduce tx size by jjyr · Pull Request #15 · nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/pull/15)

    BREAKING CHANGE: It changes the default secp256k1 script, which now uses recoverable signature.

### Features

* #937: Initial windows support (@xxuejie)
* #931: Add a function to select all tx-hashes from storage for a block (@yangby-cryptape)
* #910: Implement the alert system in CKB for urgent situation (@jjyr)

    This is a breaking change: b:p2p, b:rpc

* #939: Explicitly specify bundled or file system (@doitian)
* #972: Add `load_code` syscall (@xxuejie)
* #977: Upgrade p2p (@driftluo)

    - upgrade p2p dependence
    - support `upnp` optional

    The current identify protocol does not play a role in identifying the capabilities of both parties, and the message structure is not reasonable.

    So, I rewrote it and added the capability ID and network ID.

### BREAKING CHANGES

**Important**: The default secp256k1 code hash is changed to `0xf1951123466e4479842387a66fabfd6b65fc87fd84ae8e6cd3053edb27fff2fd`. Remember to update block assembler config.

This version is not compatible with v0.13.0, please init a new CKB directory.

### Features

* #913: New verification model (@xxuejie)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus, b:database, b:p2p, b:rpc

    Based on feedbacks gathered earlier, we are revising our verification
    model with the following changes:

    * When validating a transaction, CKB will grab all lock scripts from
      all inputs, and group them based on lock script hash. The script in
      each group will only be run once. The lock script itself will have
      to do the validation task for all inputs in the same group
    * CKB will also grab all type scripts from inputs and outputs(notice
      different from previous version, the type scripts in inputs are
      included here as well), and group them based on type script hash as
      well. Each type script in each group will also be run once. The type
      script itself needs to handle the validation task within the group
    * Syscalls are also revised to allow fetching all the
      inputs/outputs/witnesses within a single group.
    * Input args is removed since the functionality can be replicated elsewhere

* #908: Peers handle disconnect (@keroro520)
* #891: Secp256k1 multisig (@jjyr)
* #845: Limit TXO set memory usage (@yangby-cryptape)

    This is a breaking change: b:database

* #874: Revise uncle rule (@zhangsoledad)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus, b:database

    1. get rid uncle age limit
    2. try include disconnected block as uncle

* #920: Tweak consensus params (@zhangsoledad)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus

    tweak `block_cycles_limit` and `min_block_interval`

* #897: Wrap the log macros to fix ill formed macros (@yangby-cryptape)

    And, we have to update the log filters, add prefix `ckb-` for all our crates.

* #919: Synchronizer and relayer share BlocksInflight (@keroro520)
* #924: Add a transaction error `InsufficientCellCapacity` (@yangby-cryptape)
* #926: Make a better error message for miner when method not found (@yangby-cryptape)
* #961: Display miner worker status (@quake)

    BREAKCHANGE: config file `ckb-miner.toml` changed

* #1001: `ckb init` supports setting block assembler (@doitian)

    - `ckb init` accepts options `--ba-code-hash` and `--ba-arg` (which can
    repeat multiple times) to set block assembler.
    - `ckb cli secp256k1-lock` adds an output format `cmd` to prints the
    command line options for `ckb init` to set block assembler.

    The two commands can combine into one to init the directory with a secp256k1 compressed pub key:

        ckb init $(ckb cli secp256k1-lock <pubkey> --format cmd)

* #996: Tweak consensus parameters (@doitian)

    - Change target epoch duration to 4 hours
    - Reduce epoch reward to 1/4
    - Increase secondary epoch reward to 600,000 bytes


### Bug Fixes

* #878: Calculate the current median time from tip (@keroro520)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus

    Original implementation use `[Tip-BlockMedianCount .. Tip-1]` to calculate the current block median time. According to the notion of BlockMedianTime in [bip-0113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki#specification) , here change to use `[Tip-BlockMedianCount+1 .. Tip]` instead.

* #915: Sync blocked by protected peer (@TheWaWaR)
* #906: Proposal table reload (@zhangsoledad)
* #983: Uncle number should smaller than block (@zhangsoledad)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus


### Improvements

* #981 **sync:** Fix get ancestor performance issue (@TheWaWaR)

    It's a backport of PR https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/pull/970

### Misc

* #966: Backport windows support and sentry cleanup to v0.14.0 (@doitian)


# [v0.13.0](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/compare/v0.12.2...v0.13.0) (2019-06-01) rylai-v2

### Features

* #762: Live cell block hash (@keroro520)

    This is a breaking change: b:rpc

    * Return `block_hash` for `get_cells_by_lock_hash`
    * Add `make gen-doc` command

* #841: Apply `tx_pool` limit (@zhangsoledad)

    This is a breaking change: b:cli, b:rpc

    1. apply `tx_pool` limit
    2. tx size verify, enforce tx size below block size limit

    **BREAKING CHANGES:**

    **config** `ckb.toml`

    ```diff
    [tx_pool]
    - max_pool_size = 10000
    - max_orphan_size = 10000
    - max_proposal_size = 10000
    - max_cache_size = 1000
    - max_pending_size = 10000
    - txs_verify_cache_size = 100000
    + max_mem_size = 20_000_000 # 20mb
    + max_cycles = 200_000_000_000
    + max_verfify_cache_size = 100_000
    ```

    **rpc** `tx_pool_info`

    ```diff
    + "total_tx_cycles": "2",
    + "total_tx_size": "156",
    ```

* #890: Revise remainder reward rule (@zhangsoledad)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus

* #876: Tweak consensus params (@zhangsoledad)

    This is a breaking change: b:consensus

* #889: Add codename in version (@doitian)
* #854: Calculate median time by tracing parents (@keroro520)

    At present, the way calculating the passed median time is that collects block timestamps one by one by block_number. This PR change to collects blocks timestamps by tracing parents. The new way is more robust.

    In addition to this, I use assert-style to rewrite the calculation of passed median time.

* #859: Use snappy to compress large messages (@driftluo)

    This is a breaking change: b:p2p

    On the test net monitoring, the bandwidth usage is often in a full state. We try to use the snappy compression algorithm to reduce network transmission consumption.

    After testing, the compression yield of flatbuffer format is very high, cpu consumption is relatively acceptable.

    The following is the data transmission on the test net:

    ```

    Note that this is a **break change**, the data is modified as follows:

    By default, data above 40k enters compressed mode.

    From the current point of view, the high bit 1 is the compressed format and the high bit 0 is the uncompressed format.

    If you want to support multiple compression formats in the future, you can simply think that 0b1000 is in snappy format and 0b0000 is in uncompressed format.

* #344: Revise script structure r=xxuejie a=xxuejie

* #425: Bundle app config in compiled binary a=doitian

### Improvements

* #392: avoid recursive lock a=zhangsoledad

### BREAKING CHANGES

This release has changed core data structure, please delete the old data directory.

The testnet chain spec is also changed, which is incompatible with previous versions.

Command line argument `-c` is removed, and a new command line argument `-C` is added. See `ckb help` for details.

Now the command `ckb` no longer searches the config file `nodes/default.toml`. It looks for the config file `ckb.toml` or `ckb-miner.toml` in current directory and uses the default config options when not found. A new command `ckb init` is added, see its usage with `ckb init --help`.

Config file `ckb.toml` changes:

- Removed `logger.file`, `db.path` and `network.path` from config file.
- Added config option `logger.log_to_stdout` and `logger.log_to_file`.
- Section `block_assembler` now accepts two options `binary_hash` and `args`.
- Added a new option to set sentry DSN.

File `miner.toml` changes:

- Option `spec` is moved under `chain`, which is consistent with `ckb.toml`.
- Move miner own config options under section `miner`.
- Remove `logger.file` from config file.
- Add config option `logger.log_to_stdout` and `logger.log_to_file`.

It is recommended to export the config files via `ckb init`, then apply the
modifications upon the new config files.


# [v0.8.0](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0) (2019-04-08)

### Features

* #336: index whether a tx is a cellbase in the chain r=quake a=u2

    Index whether a tx is a cellbase in the chain, prepare for the cellbase outputs maturity checking.

    Now saving the cellbase index and block number in the `TransactionMeta`, there is another implementation which creates a `HashMap<tx_hash, number>`. The second one may be a little memory saving, but this one is more simple. I think both are ok.

# [v0.2.0](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) (2018-12-17)

In this release, we have upgraded to Rust 2018. We also did 2 important refactoring:

- The miner now runs as a separate process.
- We have revised the VM syscalls according to VM contracts design experiments.
